## Contributing In General

Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel
free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ibm/ELM-Python-Client/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ibm/ELM-Python-Client/issues).
Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly [get in touch](#communication) with us.

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!**

Pull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested. Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make. For example:

    Fork the repo
    Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
    Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Added some feature')
    Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
    Create new Pull Request


### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm/ELM-Python-Client/issues)
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm/ELM-Python-Client/issues) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the
maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Legal

Each source file must include a license header for the MIT License using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.
e.g.

```
#
# Copyright <holder> All Rights Reserved.
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
#
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```

## Communication
Please feel free to connect with us on our [Discussions](https://github.com/IBM/ELM-Python-Client/discussions).

## Setup
No specific setup, except installing for development extracting the zip download to a dedicated folder and then `pip install -e .`

## Testing
Currently testing is by running `batchquery` using the included tests/tests.xlsx, against a private ELM server.

## Coding style guidelines
Nothing specific, but preferably neater/more PEP8-compliant than the current code!
