# example of using the elmclient package as a DOORS Next API to do reportable rest query
# exporting to CSV

# NOTE accessing the Reportable REST API may add a lot of load to your server so use with care!
# because it tries to retrieve *all* DOORS Next artifacts!
# code below only retrieves the first two pages!
